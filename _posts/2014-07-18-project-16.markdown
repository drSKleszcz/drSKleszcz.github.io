    <p>This project focused on the metrological analysis of flow rate measurements using orifice plates, a widely utilized method in various industries such as power engineering, fuel industry, and environmental engineering. The study specifically examined a 4-hole orifice plate with a module m = 0.25, installed in a pipeline with an internal diameter of 50 mm. Both numerical simulations and experimental tests were conducted to assess measurement accuracy and flow characteristics.</p>
