  <div style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>I developed a comprehensive software solution for <strong>orifice flow measurement and uncertainty analysis</strong> in accordance with <strong>PN EN ISO 5167</strong>. This tool automates complex calculations related to real gas behavior, pressure drop estimation, and uncertainty evaluation, providing engineers and researchers with a powerful and accurate flow measurement system.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Orifice Flow Coefficient (C) Calculation:</strong> Accurately determines the discharge coefficient based on fluid properties, geometry, and operating conditions.</li>

        <li><strong>Real Gas Properties & Pressure Drop Computation:</strong> Uses the <em>Redlich-Kwong</em> equation of state for air-water vapor mixtures, computing density, viscosity, heat capacity, and pressure drop across the orifice.</li>

        <li><strong>Uncertainty Analysis & Error Estimation:</strong> Calculates absolute and relative uncertainties in flow measurement based on orifice geometry and fluid parameters.</li>

        <li><strong>Automated Dimension & Diagram Generation:</strong> Automatically generates <strong>PNG diagrams</strong> with orifice dimensions, flow parameters, and uncertainty results.</li>

        <li><strong>Professional PDF Report Generation:</strong> Creates detailed reports containing all computed values, uncertainty analysis, error assessment, and flow coefficient results.</li>

        <li><strong>High-Precision Thermodynamic & Fluid Dynamic Models:</strong> Implements industry-standard models such as <em>Redlich-Kwong</em>, <em>IAPWS-95</em> for vapor properties, and <em>Lemmon (2000)</em> for air density calculations.</li>

        <li><strong>Dynamic Viscosity Computation:</strong> Uses the <em>Sutherland formula</em> with Wilke mixing rules and pressure correction models to determine viscosity under different conditions.</li>

        <li><strong>Data Visualization & Charts:</strong> Generates graphical representations of key flow characteristics, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Actual vs. linearized flow rate</li>
                <li>Pressure drop trends</li>
                <li>Flow coefficient variations</li>
                <li>Uncertainty distribution</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project automates orifice flow measurement and uncertainty analysis, providing a user-friendly solution for engineers and industry professionals. By integrating advanced computational models and automated reporting, the software enhances accuracy and efficiency in fluid dynamics applications.</p>
