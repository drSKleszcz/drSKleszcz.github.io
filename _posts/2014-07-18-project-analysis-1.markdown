    <p>
        This project focuses on the installation and optimization of a photovoltaic-powered desalination plant on Thirasia Island, Greece. Given the island's dependency on desalinated water and the high cost of fossil fuel-based electricity, the initiative aims to enhance sustainability by integrating solar energy.
