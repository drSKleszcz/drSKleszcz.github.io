  <h2>Automated Cost Estimation Software for Glycol Heat Exchange Systems</h2>
  <p>I developed a comprehensive software solution for estimating the cost of glycol-based heat exchange systems. This tool automates the selection of system components based on technical specifications, ensuring an optimal balance between performance and cost. The software is designed to streamline the planning, budgeting, and quoting process for sales and engineering teams.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Automated Component Selection:</strong> Maps all required technical specifications and selects the most cost-effective and efficient components based on input parameters such as fluid type, flow rate, heat exchanger resistance, heat exchanger volume, piping material, and system configuration.</li>

    <li><strong>Advanced Hydraulic Calculations:</strong> Determines optimal pipe sizing and system efficiency, including calculations for cross-sectional area, flow velocity, Reynolds number, pressure losses (linear and local), three-way valve resistance, and total pressure drop.</li>

    <li><strong>Pump & Component Selection:</strong> Selects appropriate pumps and system components such as safety valves, expansion tanks, shut-off and balancing valves, filters, heat exchangers, and actuators based on flow parameters and cost constraints.</li>

    <li><strong>Real-Time Cost Estimation:</strong> Integrates a company database to pull real-time pricing for components, labor, and insulation costs, allowing users to select different material options with immediate cost and performance adjustments.</li>

    <li><strong>PDF Report Generation:</strong> Automatically generates a detailed report summarizing selected components, system specifications, cost breakdown, and performance parameters for sales and engineering teams.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This project significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of pricing glycol heat exchange systems, enhancing the companyâ€™s ability to deliver precise and competitive quotations to clients.</p>
