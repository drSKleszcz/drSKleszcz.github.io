title: Automated Company-Wide Product Price List
client: Frapol
category: Software Development
description: |

    <div style="text-align: justify;">
       
        <p>A 140-page price list was developed, detailing all products offered by the company. Crafted in Microsoft Word, the document is dynamically linked to an Excel spreadsheet that retrieves real-time pricing data from the internal database. This configuration ensures the price list remains current without manual updates, enhancing efficiency and reducing potential errors.</p>
    
        <h5>Dynamic Data Integration</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Excel Spreadsheet:</strong> Designed an Excel sheet that connects to the company's database, automatically fetching the latest prices for each product.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Utilized data connections and queries within Excel to ensure that any changes in the database are immediately reflected in the spreadsheet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Automated Document Formatting</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Word-Excel Linking:</strong> Integrated the Excel spreadsheet into the Word document using linked objects and fields, allowing the Word document to display up-to-date pricing information.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Styling:</strong> Applied consistent formatting styles across the document, including headers, footers, tables, and product descriptions, to maintain a professional appearance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Efficient Workflow</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automation Scripts:</strong> Developed macros and scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as updating links and formatting tables, thereby streamlining the document update process.</li>
            <li><strong>PDF Generation:</strong> Configured the document to be easily saved as a PDF, ensuring compatibility and ease of distribution on the company's internal website.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Web Integration</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internal Website Deployment:</strong> Coordinated with the IT department to upload the PDF version of the price list to the company's intranet, making it readily accessible to employees and stakeholders.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> Established a routine for periodic updates, ensuring that the price list remains accurate and reflects any changes in product pricing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Technologies Used</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Word:</strong> For creating and formatting the price list document.</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Excel:</strong> For data retrieval and dynamic linking of pricing information.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL Database:</strong> As the source of product pricing data.</li>
            <li><strong>VBA:</strong> To develop macros for automation within Word and Excel.</li>
            <li><strong>PDF:</strong> For distributing the finalized price list.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>The implementation of this automated price list has significantly improved the efficiency of our pricing updates. It has reduced manual workload, minimized errors, and ensured that all stakeholders have access to the most current product pricing information. This project exemplifies my ability to leverage Microsoft Office tools to create integrated, automated solutions that address real-world business needs.</p>
        <p>This project not only highlights technical skills but also demonstrates an understanding of business processes and the importance of accurate, accessible information in a corporate environment.</p>
