  <div style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>I developed a comprehensive software solution for acoustic silencer modeling, optimization, and automated report generation. This tool integrates advanced mathematical modeling with industrial design parameters to optimize noise attenuation, pressure drop, and cost estimation.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mathematical Model for Acoustic Attenuation:</strong> Predicts noise reduction across multiple frequency bands based on silencer geometry and airflow characteristics.</li>

        <li><strong>Pressure Drop Calculation:</strong> Computes airflow resistance through the silencer, ensuring optimized design without excessive energy loss.</li>

        <li><strong>Automated PDF Report Generation:</strong> Creates detailed reports with silencer specifications, performance metrics, and graphical representations of acoustic attenuation.</li>

        <li><strong>Customizable Silencer Configurations:</strong> Allows selection of different baffle membranes and geometric parameters to tailor performance to specific industrial needs.</li>

        <li><strong>Optimization Tool for Acoustic Performance:</strong> Implements an intelligent optimization algorithm that automatically determines the best silencer configuration based on input parameters such as height, depth, and length. The tool calculates:
            <ul>
                <li>Optimal number of internal baffles</li>
                <li>Best material selection for maximum noise reduction</li>
                <li>Estimated weight and cost of the silencer</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Performance Visualization & Data Analysis:</strong> Generates graphical representations, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Acoustic attenuation across frequency bands</li>
                <li>Pressure drop trends</li>
                <li>Design parameter influence</li>
                <li>Optimized material vs. performance trade-offs</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project automates the silencer design process, enabling engineers to optimize noise control solutions efficiently. By integrating precise mathematical models with an intelligent optimization engine and an intuitive reporting system, the tool streamlines industrial acoustic analysis and enhances decision-making.</p>
