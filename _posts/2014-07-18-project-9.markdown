    <p>
        This project focused on evaluating the feasibility and economic viability of using CO₂ as a cushion gas for Underground Gas Storage (UGS) in Poland. The assessment included site selection, cost modeling, and sensitivity analysis to key market and operational factors.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Techno-Economic Model Development:</strong> 
            A model was developed to analyze capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures, considering costs related to:
            <ul>
                <li>Drilling</li>
                <li>CO₂ and natural gas injection</li>
                <li>Gas processing</li>
                <li>Site decommissioning</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Uncertainty Analysis with Monte Carlo Simulation:</strong> 
            The study incorporated a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations to account for uncertainties in:
            <ul>
                <li>Gas prices</li>
                <li>Electricity costs</li>
                <li>Technical parameters</li>
            </ul>
            Results showed that over 90% of the simulated scenarios yielded a positive Net Present Value (NPV), highlighting the strong profitability potential of CO₂-cushioned UGS.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Economic Drivers and Profitability:</strong> 
            The main economic driver is the seasonal gas price disparity, supplemented by financial benefits from CO₂ storage under emissions trading schemes. Key findings include:
            <ul>
                <li>High profitability potential due to gas price differences</li>
                <li>Risks from high electricity costs and minimal gas price differences</li>
                <li>Risk mitigation strategies like optimizing gas procurement and using gas-driven compressors</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>End-of-Life CO₂ Storage Benefits:</strong> 
            At the end of the project’s lifecycle, the storage site can be fully filled with CO₂, providing:
            <ul>
                <li>Further economic benefits</li>
                <li>Environmental benefits by contributing to carbon management initiatives</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Overall, the project demonstrates that integrating CO₂ storage with UGS can enhance financial returns while contributing to carbon management initiatives, making it a viable solution for energy storage and emissions reduction.
