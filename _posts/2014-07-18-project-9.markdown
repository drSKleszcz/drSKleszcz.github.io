    <p>
        In response to the rising electricity prices in Norway and Europe, this study presents a novel approach for evaluating the techno-economic feasibility of micro-combined heat and power (m-CHP) systems powered by Micro Gas Turbines (MGTs). This investigation focuses on m-CHP systems fueled by natural gas (NG) and a blend of NG and hydrogen (H2) at a ratio of 23% by volume, offering a sustainable solution to the energy challenges faced in the region. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590174524000382?via%3Dihub"> Read more </a>
