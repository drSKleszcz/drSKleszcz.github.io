    <p>
        This project focused on developing an advanced flow measurement system for flow regulators, achieving a 5% increase in measurement accuracy and a 32.0% reduction in pressure drop. These enhancements significantly improved product performance and contributed to increased product sales.
    </p>
    <p>
        The design approach was based on the formula used by Belimo in actuators dedicated to Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems: 
        <br><em>V = c · √(∆p/ρ)</em>, 
        where maintaining a constant coefficient (<em>c</em>) throughout the measurement range of 2-20 m/s was identified as a critical factor. Below 2 m/s, measurement accuracy becomes challenging due to the minimal pressure difference (∆p) between total and static pressures at the measuring element.
    </p>
    <p>
        A key design aspect was optimizing the positioning of pressure sensing ports. The layout was calculated using the "log-linear" method, commonly applied in cross-sectional traversing for Prandtl tube measurements. This method is grounded in the theoretical velocity distribution within a duct and is compliant with the ISO 3966:2008 standard.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project included the development and testing of multiple prototypes, supported by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The prototypes were subjected to rigorous testing under various conditions, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>After obstacles such as 3-way valves</li>
        <li>Downstream of single and double bends</li>
        <li>Following different lengths of straight duct sections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These tests ensured the system's accuracy and reliability under real-world operating conditions. The results demonstrated consistent performance improvements, validating the design's effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project showcases a high level of technical expertise in fluid dynamics and flow measurement, leveraging advanced CFD analysis and practical testing methodologies to deliver a superior flow regulation solution.
